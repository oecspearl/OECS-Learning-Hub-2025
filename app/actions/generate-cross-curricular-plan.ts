## Lesson Structure

### Introduction/Hook
${
  introduction ||
  `
- Begin with an engaging hook that connects multiple subject areas
- Activate prior knowledge across disciplines
- Present the big idea and learning objectives
`
}

### Core Learning Activities
${
  coreActivities ||
  `
- Activity 1: Integration of ${primarySubject || "primary subject"} with ${supportingSubjects || "supporting subjects"}
- Activity 2: Cross-disciplinary exploration
- Activity 3: Application of integrated concepts
`
}

### Closure Activities
${
  closureActivities ||
  `
- Synthesize learning across subject areas
- Reflect on connections between disciplines
- Preview upcoming related content
`
}

## Differentiation Strategies
${
  differentiationStrategies ||
  `
- For advanced students: Extended cross-curricular applications
- For students needing support: Scaffolded activities with clear connections
- For diverse learning styles: Multiple modes of engagement and expression
`
}

## Assessment Methods
${
  assessmentMethods ||
  `
- Formative: Observe student understanding of cross-curricular connections
- Summative: Integrated project demonstrating learning across subjects
- Reflection: Student self-assessment of interdisciplinary understanding
`
}
