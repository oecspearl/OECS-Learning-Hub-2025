            <p>
              In Grade 3, students build on their understanding of addition and subtraction while developing fluency
              with multiplication and division. The four operations are interconnected, with addition and subtraction
              being inverse operations, and multiplication and division being inverse operations. Understanding these
              relationships helps students develop efficient strategies and check their work. Students should be
              encouraged to use multiple strategies and representations when solving problems, and to explain their
              reasoning. The development of fact fluency is important, but should be built on conceptual understanding
              rather than rote memorization. Teachers should emphasize the application of operations in real-world
              contexts to help students see the relevance and utility of these mathematical skills.
