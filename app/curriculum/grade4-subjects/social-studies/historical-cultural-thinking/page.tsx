              The Indigenous people were the first inhabitants of the Caribbean. Ta√≠nos settled in the Greater Antilles
              (Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico), while Kalinagos settled in the Lesser Antilles (St. Lucia,
              Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica). Both groups shared Trinidad and Puerto Rico.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Indigenous societies had their own social structures and economic practices. Their communities were called
              Chiefdoms, religion played an important role in their way of life, and they farmed, fished, and bartered
              to meet their needs. Their societies practiced cultural traditions, including pottery-making and
              stone-carving.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              The early European groups that came to the Caribbean before the 1800s include the Spanish, French, Dutch,
              and British. They came to seek wealth through resources like gold, to spread their religious beliefs, and
              to gain fame (glory).
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              European colonization brought both positive changes (new technology, crops, foods, animals) and negative
              changes (diseases, loss of traditions and customs, land appropriation, loss of freedom, forced labor) to
              Indigenous societies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, communities of Indigenous people can be found in various Caribbean countries, including Dominica,
              St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, Belize, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and Guyana. They have preserved
              aspects of their culture such as traditional arts and crafts, music and dance, storytelling traditions,
              medicinal practices, agricultural practices, and hunting techniques.
