              Addition and subtraction are two operations which must be clear to young children. Addition in math is a
              process of combining two or more numbers. Addends are the numbers being added, and the result or the final
              answer we get after the process is called the sum. The operation or process of finding the difference
              between two numbers or quantities is known as subtraction. Multiplication is one of the four basic Math
              operations. It is the opposite of division. When we multiply numbers (factors), our answer (product) gets
              bigger. Multiplication gives the same answer as repeated addition, that is, we add the same
              number/quantity a number of times.
