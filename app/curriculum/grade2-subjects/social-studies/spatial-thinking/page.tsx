            In Grade 2, students develop an understanding that islands are made up of many diverse regions and communities. 
            They learn about cardinal directions, mapping, features of communities, plants and animals, weather patterns,
            and the environment as a resource. This knowledge helps students understand their physical surroundings and
            their relationship to the natural world.
