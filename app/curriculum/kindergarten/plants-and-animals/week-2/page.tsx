        title="Making Abstract Concepts Concrete"
        tip="The concept of 'survival' can be abstract for young children. Make it concrete by relating it to their daily experiences: 'Just like you need food when you're hungry and water when you're thirsty, plants and animals need certain things to stay alive and healthy.' Use simple analogies that connect to children's lives, such as comparing a plant's need for water to their own need for water when they're thirsty."
